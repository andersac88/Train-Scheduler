# Train-Scheduler

This application is a fictional train scheduling app.

You input a 'Train Name', a 'Destination', the time of the first train and their frequency. 

The app will then output when the next tain will arrive and how many minutes that is from the current time, which is displayed in the Jumbotron.

Trains can also be deleted by clicking the respective Delete button.

This app is an introduction to Firebase and moment JS but also reinforces CSS, Bootstrap, HTML and JQuery.

This project is currently maintained and updated by Andrew Andersen (andersac88@gmail.com) if you have any questions, feel free to contact me directly.
